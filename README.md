This is a modified version of the corne keyboard by foostan. It is wireless and uses zmk firmware.
- uses Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840 
- support for rotary encoder on each half
- support for nice!view oled (untested)
- power button and JST header to plug 3.7v lipo battery

*You can place either an oled or an encoder due to limited space*
